The flashlight example code was shared with me by Stephanie, although it was written by someone else in the Stanford Autonomous Systems Lab (ASL).
Original code is here: https://github.com/acauligi/astrobee-tamp/blob/master/misc/strips.ipynb
This is what I based my ReachBot STRIPS implementation off of.
